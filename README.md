# Niz

A personal wrapper script for the [`nix`](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/new-cli/nix) command that adds command-line flags that aren't available as config options.

This is personal and probably not directly useful for other people, but feel free to yoink it for your own purposes ^_^
